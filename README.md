# Arduino-Radar-University-Project
Arduino based Radar written in C++ with Processing being done in Java, leveraging real-time data using an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor.

This project was made for the completion of my Embedded Systems course at university; completed on the 7th of January 2020.

Tools used:

1.Arduino IDE - for programming the Arduino UNO microcontroller

2.Processing IDE - UI and data processing

3.Fritzing - design of project schematic
